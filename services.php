The drums are then inspected. If the drums pass inspection they are capped and their labels are removed. The drums are then blasted to remove all exterior coatings and identifying marks. The drums are then inspected for any exterior imperfections.
                If any drums do not pass any of our three inspections or is unable to meet the current UN regulations they are washed, crushed, and recycled into a raw steel resource.</p>
